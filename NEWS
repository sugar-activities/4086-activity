  - Icon modified to display in Mediawiki renderer correctly (works fine
    everywhere else).
  - Added a reward graphic when the level is successfully cleared.
  - Rewrote board data structure to one that should be more effective.

    levels, and the rest were solvable in a certain way that makes the game
    easier once you know about it.  The new one should be more robust.

  - Completed sliding animation.
  - Implemented undo/redo.
  - Added "sugarless" file for developing in a non-Sugar environment.

TODO: 
- The game could detect a loss and display a "Try again" graphic?
- Rectangle invalidation could be improved.
- A tutorial mode or sequence of introductory games might help.
- The code documentation and organization could be improved. Some
  calculations are repeated.
- Audio cues might be nice.
- Tracking win/loss statistics might be nice.
